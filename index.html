<p class="title">How To Read A Dictionary</p>

Hey GCD.<br>
<br> It can be hard knowing what to trust and who did what in the world of design. Designers use other people’s work as inspiration, they twist archive materials, and sometimes they just flat out lie. But stick with me and I’ll show you how to use the rigid order of a dictionary to make the world of design nice and clear.<br>
<br>
How To with John Wilson is a documentary series covering topics ranging from finding a public restroom, to investing in real estate, to learning how to be spontaneous. Each episode is filmed from John’s first person perspective, mixing Louis Theroux-esque interviews with voyeuristic clips of humorous, idiosyncratic things and people found around New York’s streets; all narrated by John Wilson’s stuttery, monotone, nasal voice.<br>
<br>

How To Watch Birds is the fifth episode of the third and final season, and starts with John deciding to spend more time outside and investigate bird watching, and ends up with him meeting and hanging out with a Titanic conspiracy theorist, while in the background the episode really talks about honesty, integrity, truth, and ethics of making a documentary.<br>
<br>

I see a lot of conceptual similarity between my work taking discarded, forgotten, or unwanted artefacts and recontextualising them to create a small part of a larger, crafted narrative and the way How To with John Wilson uses footage from unknowing participants found in public life as short companion clips to the larger narrated story presented throughout an episode. For example, at the start of this episode John talks about how looking up can reveal danger (footage of someone abseiling to clean windows), scandal (footage of people having sex by a high up hotel window), and suspense (footage of a dog trapped on a ledge outside an apartment). This is…<br>
<br>

Although this is also an area where there is a tension between my work and Wilson’s, as everyone that appears in How To… signs a release form after the footage has been taken [2] but I have never obtained consent or permission for my work, whether taking test prints from the Publications workshop, using (presumably) copyrighted images from the LAION archive, or using animated gifs from a retired professor’s website. This has led to AAA.<br>
<br>

How To Watch Birds articulates its themes of transparency and using other people as content, both directly and indirectly, using the narration as well as the form of the episode itself. When John takes a polygraph test he is asked “Have you ever lied to someone on your show?” he pauses before replying “No.” the test operator says this is a lie. And later on the episode shows…<br>
<br>

This made me think…<br>
<br>

The episode also investigates the show as a whole, which often presents itself as very casual and off the cuff, with John umming and ahhing while narrating, despite the fact that his dialogue is all clearly scripted and planned to fit the narrative of the episode. AAA<br>
<br>

This relates to my work and the way I present it…<br>
<br>

I also find the idea of going down rabbit holes to be an important part of my practice and my process, but it’s sometimes something I struggle to think of it as a serious investigative or narrative framework. It’s something that is embodied well by the episode and the show generally, by starting with seemingly innocuous topics like bird watching John is able to disarm the viewer, and without even really noticing you become engrossed in the deeper topic. This is something I’ve tried to do with my RIP THE NET and Triangulating 1 projects, when making them I became fascinated with the LAION database and Prof. Dr. style websites, and I let myself just explore the archives without necessarily having an outcome in mind. And then when it came to creating the outcome I tried to structure them to lure the viewer in with recognisable imagery, while containing a deeper message underneath.<br>
